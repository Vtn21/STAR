## üç¥ About this fork <a name = "about"></a>

The [original repository](https://github.com/ahmedosman/STAR) requires cloning, updating path definitions in a specific config file (pointing to the .npz files of the STAR model), and then installing with pip (see [this section](https://github.com/ahmedosman/STAR#Installation) of the original README for details).

This fork aims at enabling installing the package without having to modify any of the source files. Instead, the model path is specified when instantiating the model (see *demos* folder for examples).

See below for updated [Content](#content) and [Installation and Usage](#Installation) sections. Remaining sections are inherited from the original repository.

## Description

STAR - A **S**parse **T**rained  **A**rticulated Human Body **R**egressor is a generateive 3D human body model, that is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the widely used SMPL model.
STAR is trained on a large dataset of 14,000 human subjects, with a learned set of sparse and spatially local pose corrective
blend shapes. In the Figure below, a single joint movement only influences a sparse set of the model vertices. The mesh vertices in
gray are not affected by the joint movement. In contrast, for SMPL, bending the left elbow causes a bulge in the right elbow.  <br/>
STAR is publicly avaiable with the full 300 principal-component shape space for research purposes from our website https://star.is.tue.mpg.de/

## Installation

### Install

It is recommended to do the following in a [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) (or python3) virtual environment.

1. Install your favorite framework

* Chumpy
```
pip install chumpy==0.69
pip install opencv-python
```

* PyTorch
```
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.0 -c pytorch
```

* Tensorflow
```
pip install tensorflow
```

2. Install this repository through pip

```
pip install git+https://github.com/Vtn21/STAR
```

3. Download the models from the STAR website https://star.is.tue.mpg.de/ (registration required) and unpack them to a directory of your choice.

### Usage

Under demos/* there are scripts demonstrating how to load and use the model in all frameworks.
```bash
    $PATH_TO_REPO/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ demos
    ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ compare_frameworks.py #Unit test script constructing the model with three frameworks and comparing the output
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ load_chumpy.py        #A script demonstrating loading the model in chumpy
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ load_tf.py            #A script demonstrating loading the model in Tensorflow
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ load_torch.py         #A script demonstrating loading the model in PyTorch
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ profile_tf.py         #A script profiling the STAR graph as a function of batch Size in Tensorflow
    |   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ profile_torch.py      #A script profiling the STAR graph as a function of batch Size in PyTorch
```

## SMPL Comparison
STAR is designed to be a drop in replacement for SMPL, similar to SMPL it is parameterised with pose and shape parameters, with the same template
resolution and kinematic tree.
